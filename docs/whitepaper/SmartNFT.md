# Smart NFT

SuperCharge your NFTs

v**0.1.0**

Authors: **Kumar Anirudha**

## Abstract
NFTs are awesome but it's incomplete as it is right now. PFP NFTs can only be used in so many cases. The future lies in adding utility to NFTs. In this paper we will discuss the limitations of current NFT ecosystem and how our platform can add power to your current NFTs as well as make it easier to develop and integrate NFTs.

# Introduction
In recent years, we've seen an enormous increase in NFTs and the creator communities built around it. Some apps and events have tried incorporating NFTs in their regular usage to add "utility" over these NFTs to provide actionable value to the end user. However, these are specific industries just waking up to the huge utility usage of NFTs. While at this expansion, what's lacking right now is a platform to provide developer toolset to bridge this gap.
