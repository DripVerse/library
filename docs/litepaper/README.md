# Smart NFT LitePaper

SuperCharge your NFTs

v**0.1.0**

Authors: **Kumar Anirudha**

## Abstract
NFTs are awesome but it's incomplete as it is right now. PFP NFTs can only be used in so many cases. The future lies in adding utility to NFTs. In this paper we will discuss the limitations of current NFT ecosystem and how our platform can add power to your current NFTs as well as make it easier to develop, integrate and use NFTs as integrations to various platforms.

# Introduction
In recent years, we've seen an enormous increase in NFTs and the creator communities built around it. The usual idea of an NFT would come from creating a digital twin of a physical object or artwork that can be uniquely identified and marked ownership of in a decentralised ecosystem. The value of an NFT lies in the uniqueness and rarity of it as well as how the market values it.
Some projects have tried incorporating NFTs in their regular usage to add "utility" over these NFTs to provide actionable value to the end user. However, these are either utility as a service model or specific industries just waking up to the new value found in utility usage of NFTs.

## Summary
The lack of value beyond what the market determines for PGP NFTs is a dead end. Presently, the only reason anybody would mint NFT would be place it on a market and trade it so they can earn out of it. For any new artists, this means large scale marketing and promotional arcitivities. But once someone acquires such NFTs, there is not much that can be done with it than hoping the value of it rises over time given the rarity of the same and hopefully re-list at a later stage on some marketplace. Even when we have some NFTs on our wallet. There's really not much to do with it. So, what is the added value to it apart from any other fungible tokens?

## Adding Utility to NFTs
We are starting to see some artists and celebrities coming up with their own NFTs, which provides access to exclusive content, events and deals in respect to the artist who's NFT we might have acquired. This is a great step towards adding utility over PGP NFTs and in turn adds additional value to it. Of course, these can still be traded over any marketaplces. There is also real world objects which are connecting with digital twins using NFTs which provides access to the same digital object in a Metaverse. Even some events and concerts have started adding NFT tickets, which adds further actionable value to the NFT. There are various industries pushing added value to the NFT which is brings us to the next upgrade over NFT, also sometimes called as NFT2.0 or Smart NFTs.

# Smart NFT (Solution 2)
Smart NFTs is the next step in the evolution of NFTs which creates and distributes NFTs with programmable, actionable utility.
We provide an SDK and other dev tools to ease this process of creating Smart NFTs. Our custom variation of ERC721 and ERC1155 as well as ERC4907 provides embedded utility inside the smart contract itself, which is linked back to additional private information readable by our SDKs and client libraries to support on various platforms, like mobile (Android, iOS), desktop(Linux, Mac, Windows) and web(Browser).

# Interoperable Assets - MultiLink
Just adding more value to existing NFTs is not enough if it's limited to a single network. We also need to support multiple networks as well as be able to move the assets seemlessly across chains. We're creating our own custom NFT Bridge to support not only Layer 1 networks like Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, but also Layer 2 networks like Polygon, Starknet, ZkSync, and many more. We'll also integrate external bridges like Router Protocol to add further support for token bridging and provide more options to the users.
