# Getting Started

:::info
Currently works only on Polygon Testnet.

DripVerse CLI is a tool for your command line or terminal. It'll need very little resource and can perform bigger tasks directly on the network, with a secure offline wallet management. It can run on any machine having a terminal interface option, including remote virtual machines and IoT Devices.

If you have questions, tweet to us at [@0xDripVerse](https://twitter.com/0xDripVerse). If you wish to contribute to the project, make sure that you read our contribution guide.

We are glad that you are here!
