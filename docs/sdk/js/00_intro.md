# Getting Started

![For JavaScript and TypeScript](/docs/assets/welcome-pages/js-ts.jpeg "For JavaScript and TypeScript")

The JavaScript SDK handles communications between your JavaScript App and DripVerse.

The dripverse.js library is free to use and will be open-source soon. Start integrating it from the Setup page.

If you have questions, tweet to us at [@0xDripVerse](https://twitter.com/0xDripVerse). If you wish to contribute to the project, make sure that you read our contribution guide.

We are glad that you are here!
