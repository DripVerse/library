Utility are usually properties of a digital object. A collection is simply a collection of such digital objects. However, there might be situations, where a creator might have to enable a utility for the collection to have it available to be enabled for a digital object or NFT.

Colleciton Utility are utilities created from artefacts for a specific collection. They're separate smart contracts deployed with a collection in mind, and hence can not be used for a different collection. Of course, you can always create a new utility for a separate collection from the same artefact.
