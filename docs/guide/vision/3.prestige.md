To build a complete CyberSpace, one of the most crucial building blocks we would need is an Open Metaverse OS. Calling out early sometimes is also calling out wrong. However, in this case, an Open Metaverse OS is kinda inevitable. Outlier Ventures defines a very descriptive [paper](https://outlierventures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OV-Metaverse-OS_V6.pdf) on Open Metaverse OS from 2021. This stage is highly influenced by the paper specially cause a lot of aspects falls directly under our own larger vision of Cyberspace.

Here's some of the impressive parts of the paper:

> The Open Metaverse OS is best understood as an evolving collection of highly composable technologies that will increasingly, but selectively, be used to make aspects of an Open Metaverse possible as it seeks to serve a greater global population across several use cases and environments.

> This way of thinking about the Open Metaverse OS also allows a framework through which to
assess the openness or, otherwise, design choices and trade-offs made by a given instance of the
Metaverse including; is the code open source, are the assets portabile, is the data platform
proprietary or user controlled, who can create value, and the degree of UGC versus platform made
and how can it be monetized

_However way we look at it, it's pretty much spot on. Clearly a thorough research was done. This can act as a good starting point. However, for our case, this has to be further extended beyond._
