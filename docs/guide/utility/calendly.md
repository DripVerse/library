Calendly is your scheduling automation platform that you are already aware of. However, it might get quite troublesome to have your calendar publicly available, while you'd want to restrict to an exclusive audience alone. Provide access to your NFT holder to schedule appointment with you.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of setting up your gated calendly url using an NFT utility in Dripverse.

- Head over to our [quickstart guide](https://library.dripverse.org/guide/quickstart) to get a general understanding of how to mint your first NFT and adding utilities.
- Once you've minted your NFT, you can use it to token gate your Discord server.
