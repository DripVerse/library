NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collections are sets of digital assets, often in the form of images, videos, or other digital media, that are tokenized on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership of a unique digital item, and these tokens are stored securely on a blockchain, providing proof of ownership and authenticity.

NFT collections can vary widely in content and theme, ranging from digital art and collectibles to music, videos, virtual real estate, and more. These collections are typically created by artists, creators, or developers who tokenize their work and offer it for sale to collectors.

Each NFT within a collection is unique and can have different attributes, such as rarity, characteristics, or properties, which can affect its value within the collection. Collectors often buy, sell, and trade these NFTs on various online platforms and marketplaces that support NFT transactions.

Some popular NFT collections have gained significant attention and value in the digital art and collectibles space, with individual NFTs selling for substantial amounts of money in online auctions and sales.

Ideally, each collection is a separate smart contract on-chain or identified by a unique address on-chain. Each Collection can contain one or more NFTs. A collection will usually have a single creator. However, there might be more than one involved, like a group of individuals or an organisation.
