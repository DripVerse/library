NFT Drops is a feature that allows brands and creators to distribute pre-minted NFTs amongst an allowed group of users. Usually, these are free of cost drops used to promote the project. However, NFT Drops can also be chargeable if the brand or creator chooses so.

## Allowlist
There are various ways to use allowlist feature alongwith drops:
1. Drop NFTs to all users in allowlist.
2. Drop limited number of NFTs to some users at random from an allowlist.

## Transfer vs Drop
Although the underlying logic might be same, the motivation behind these are very different. Transfer is when you know who to send it to. Drop is mostly chosen at random and might not be associated with any particular user.
