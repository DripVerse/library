Soul is the principle of life, feeling, thought, and action in humans, regarded as a distinct entity separate from the body, and commonly held to be separable in existence from the body; the spiritual part of humans as distinct from the physical part.

As such, we can divide this existence into several parts:

- **Personality**: This is the most vivid aspect. Personality builds over time, given a human's experience with actions and environment. So, can we perhaps give a certain definition to it, if we know a person's history? Will two people growing up in exact same situation, given exact same environment, everything exact same, have exact same personality?
- **Feeling**: This can be a by-product of personality. Given a certain exposure to object, conversation, visual or audio, what reaction does this soul make.
- **Thought**: What are the various thoughts that comes to mind, once you hear, see or feel something.
- **Actions**: What possible actions are feasible to you given a certain scenario.

All of these comprisingly make up a soul.

_The concept of "soulbound" assets on the blockchain was first discussed in a January 2022 blog post by Buterin. In it, he explained that in the popular fantasy game World of Warcraft there are powerful "soulbound items" that cannot be transferred or sold to another player once picked up._ -- [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-soulbound-tokens-the-non-transferrable-nft-explained/)

_Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, financialized assets, rather than encoding social relationships of trust. Yet many core economic activities‚Äîsuch as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands‚Äîare built on persistent, non-transferable relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how non-transferable ‚Äúsoulbound‚Äù tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of ‚ÄúSouls‚Äù can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation. More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem ‚ÄúDecentralized Society‚Äù (DeSoc)‚Äîa co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms‚Äîsuch as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores‚Äîthat reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination. With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today‚Äôs hyper-financialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance._ -- [Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763).

There have been several EIPs to recreate the idealogy so far already. However, what's missing is a consistent approach to it, which would make a standard stand-out.
