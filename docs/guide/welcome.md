_If you have made this far, you are curious about the future of the web3 and ecosystem as much as we are._

DripVerse can be described as a **Modular Digital Assets Stack**. Which means a collection of tools and infrastructure put together in a way to solve usage and development of all digital assets.

DripVerse Protocol aims to improve web3 dev tooling and infrastructure for the builders and creators starting with improving the post-mint experience.<br />
DripVerse is build on non-fungible tokens with utilities built over it called as SmartNFT. SmartNFT is the current focus of our team, so let's understand a little more about them.

## The Problem

When we think about digital assets, we think of NFTs as it is the most widely adopted digital asset today. We love our art and meme NFTs for sure. But there's no other utility to them. And sometimes they're overpriced due to various circumstances, which then leads to a stagnation in the market for such assets. The only way to add utility to an NFT is by re-creating them, i.e. burn existing ones and mint again with more features embedded this time in the smart contract. This is both inefficient and also loses the entire history of the said NFTs.

## Adding Utility to NFTs

DripVerse Protocol is here to enable post-mint experience to creators. We aim to standardise practices and provide elegant dev-tools to help builders create the next generation of Web3 products. Powered by a robust NFT bridge to bring interoperable assets with zkproofs, DripVerse is the first step towards a truly open Metaverse Operating System.
We're starting with adding utilities to NFTs. First use-case on Token Gating, NFT Tickets and Phygital Collectibles are already under way. A complete disruption of not just developer experience but also user behaviour is underway. There's still a long road ahead of us, and we hope to count on your guidance on this mission to create an impressive experience. There are various industries pushing added value to the NFT which is brings us to the next upgrade over NFT, also sometimes called as NFT2.0 or Smart NFTs.

## Smart NFT

Smart NFTs is the next step in the evolution of NFTs which creates and distributes NFTs with programmable and actionable utility.
We provide an SDK and other dev tools to ease the process of creating Smart NFTs. Our custom variation of ERC721 and ERC1155 as well as ERC4907 provides embedded utility inside the smart contract itself, which is linked back to additional private information readable by our SDKs and client libraries to support on various platforms, like mobile (Android, iOS), desktop(Linux, Mac, Windows) and web(Browser).
