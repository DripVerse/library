_If you have made this far, you are curious about the future of the web3 and ecosystem as much as we are._

DripVerse is an open web protocol for the decentralised web3 ecosystem. DripVerse comprises of suite of protocols and tools integrated to work seamlessly cross-chain with a MetaverseOS at it's core, that allows developers and users to build and interact both while allowing open and free customisation of the protocol itself.

DripVerse is build on non-fungible tokens with utilities built over it called as SmartNFT. SmartNFT is the current focus of our team, so let's understand a little more about them.

## Adding Utility to NFTs
We are starting to see some artists and celebrities coming up with their own NFTs, which provides access to exclusive content, events and deals in respect to the artist who's NFT we might have acquired. This is a great step towards adding utility over PGP NFTs and in turn adds additional value to it. Of course, these can still be traded over any marketplaces. There is also real world objects which are connecting with digital twins using NFTs which provides access to the same digital object in a Metaverse. Even some events and concerts have started adding NFT tickets, which adds further actionable value to the NFT. There are various industries pushing added value to the NFT which is brings us to the next upgrade over NFT, also sometimes called as NFT2.0 or Smart NFTs.

## Smart NFT
Smart NFTs is the next step in the evolution of NFTs which creates and distributes NFTs with programmable and actionable utility.
We provide an SDK and other dev tools to ease the process of creating Smart NFTs. Our custom variation of ERC721 and ERC1155 as well as ERC4907 provides embedded utility inside the smart contract itself, which is linked back to additional private information readable by our SDKs and client libraries to support on various platforms, like mobile (Android, iOS), desktop(Linux, Mac, Windows) and web(Browser).
