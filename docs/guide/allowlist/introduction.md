An allowlist is a list of user accounts that are bundled together for easier access to certain privileges or treatment. It is the opposite of a blocklist, which is intended to block or restrict access.

Allowlist can be created on DripVerse Protocol from the platform as well as using the SDK. Let's learn more about different types of allowlists and how to make the most of it.

## Temporary Allowlist
At the present, DripVerse supports temporary allowlists. Which means the allowlists are not stored anywhere except during the process to occur. This feature can be accessed from the dashboard. You can upload a list of user accounts as CSV, then select from your owned NFTs to assign them in random to this list.

## Permanent Allowlist [Coming Soon]
With permanent allowlist, you can get even more flexibility. More details to be updated soon.
